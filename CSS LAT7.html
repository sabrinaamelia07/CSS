            When I until Senior High school, five years ago, I and my clasmates visited Borobudur Temple. We went to Borobudur Temple by bus from our school in Jakarta. We left our school at nine o’ clock and arrived at night. Along the road, we saw many vehicles, unique house, prominent building, rice field, and some ather tourists.
            Because we arrived in the night, we lived in The Hotel. In the morning, we went to Borobudur Temple. After we arrived at there, one of my teachers went to buy tickets for us. Then we went up to the top of Borobudur Temple. A Guide explained about history of Borobudur. From the top of the temple we can see beautiful scenery. I and my friends went around the temple together.We felt tired, but we felt so happy. The Borobudur Temple is The greatest temple in Indonesia. I loved that.
